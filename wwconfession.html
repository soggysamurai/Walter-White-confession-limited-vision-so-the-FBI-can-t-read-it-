<p>My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my</p>
<p>confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead- murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank</p>
<p>has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th</p>
<p>birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using</p>
<p>connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was… astounded. I… I always thought Hank was a</p>
<p>very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was</p>
<p>reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and</p>
<p>showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my</p>
<p>family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold</p>
<p>me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.</p>
<p>Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess… I guess</p>
<p>you call it a "hit" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills,</p>
<p>which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man</p>
<p>named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no</p>
<p>option in it. I have often contemplated s-icide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened.</p>
<p>Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three</p>
<p>months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I</p>
<p>was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in</p>
<p>response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in "Blood Money."] I can't take this</p>
<p>anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to</p>
<p>make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.</p>
